Snufkin's Community Pack Server Side Vehicles (A19 - Stable) 12th of June 2021
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==========
BACKGROUND
==========
By utlizing in game assets without any need for external additions, Snufkin was able to create new vehicles by using an innovative approach of attaching prefabs and other effects to existing vehicles. In some cases you will recognise the base model, as with the Hell Beast motorcycle. However, other vehicles will only use a stock vehicle as base and appear totally unique in form and function, such as the parachute.

Other modders are heeding Snufkin's call for the community to exploit the xmls and create their own versions. This Community Pack compiles a variety of new creations as well as tweaks to the original existing code to ensure context and stability.

The current vehicle list, which can be produced on the workbench is as follows:

Armored Car - 4 seater (Snufkin)
Army Truck - 6 seater (Snufkin with stability and context edits by oakraven)
Raft - 4 seater (Snufkin)

Issue 5 (Reported by h0tr0d and fixed for functionality by oakraven)
Warning with collision for Army Truck

Non-convex MeshCollider with non-kinematic Rigidbody is no longer supported since Unity 5.
If you want to use a non-convex mesh either make the Rigidbody kinematic or remove the Rigidbody component. Scene hierarchy path "Entities/Cars/Army Truck_256087/Physics/Box1/tempPrefab_armyTruckPrefab/armyTruck", Mesh asset path "" Mesh name "army_truck_collider"

Changed:
items.xml
<property name="Meshfile" value="#Entities/Vehicles?Truck/armyTruckPrefab.prefab"/>
to
<property name="Meshfile" value="#Entities/Vehicles?jeep_Prefab.prefab"/>

While the warning persists until the collision in the model can be updated, it is now as easy to place as any other vehicle. This method can also be applied for additional vehicles added to the mod that present similar collision issues but can retain functionality such as the Magic Bus by oakraven.
